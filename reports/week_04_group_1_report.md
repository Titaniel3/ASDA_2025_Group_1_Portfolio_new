## Airbnb Report Group 1

**Project Report Suggested Structure**

**Scenario**

You are a team of data analysts working for the **European Commission for Sustainable Cities**. Your task is to explore Airbnb data from ten European cities and write a **clear, data-driven report** about the current state of the Airbnb market and its possible connections to **gentrification**.

This is an **exploratory analysis**, not a full scientific study. You are not expected to run statistical tests or build models. Instead, focus on describing what the data shows — for example, how Airbnb listings, prices, and guest satisfaction differ across cities, and whether some of these patterns might suggest housing pressure or early signs of gentrification.

Support your discussion with **figures or plots** that help illustrate your points. Each figure should be:

* properly labeled and titled,  
* briefly described in a caption, and  
* clearly mentioned in the text where it’s relevant.

Your report should be **concise, factual, and readable** — avoid long theoretical discussions or unnecessary text. The goal is to communicate insights that a city planner or policymaker could easily understand.

**Important:** Do **not** include code in the report. All code and data analysis belong in your Jupyter notebook.
